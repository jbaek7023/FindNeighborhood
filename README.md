# Neighborhood App

* Find the location of your neighborhood! 

* Used Knockout.js (MVVM), Bootstrap Framework, and jQuery to create a program that takes the browserâ€™s
location, prompts the user to choose Coffee, Pizza or Tacos, then lists locations on a map. 

* Utilized Google Maps Javascript API, Google Places API and Foursquare API (information for location)
